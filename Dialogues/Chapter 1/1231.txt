So Emil, here's 170 marks, give 140 to grandma. Tell her that I hope she's doing fine and give her a kiss for me. The other 30 marks is for you, you'll need 10 marks for your return fare and keep the remaining money in your pocket in case anything turns out. I'll put it inside the Envelope. Don't lose it.
